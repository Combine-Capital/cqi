### Known Limitations

- Database package coverage lower due to integration-test-heavy design (unit tests cover all testable logic)
- Bus package coverage reflects JetStream-specific code paths not exercised in unit tests
- All packages meet functional requirements and production-ready status

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features (Post-MVP)
