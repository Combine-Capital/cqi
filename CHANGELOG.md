## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added

#### Service Management
- **Service Lifecycle**: HTTP and gRPC server abstractions with graceful shutdown

- **Service Orchestration**: Multi-service runner with dependency management
  - `runner.Runner` for managing multiple services
  - Dependency resolution with topological sort
  - Automatic service restart with configurable policies (Never, Always, OnFailure)
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (prevents thundering herd)
  - Start delays for controlled service initialization
  - Aggregate health checking across all services

- **Service Discovery**: Registry for dynamic service registration
  - `registry.LocalRegistry` for in-memory registration (development/testing)
  - `registry.RedisRegistry` for distributed service discovery (production)
  - Automatic heartbeat mechanism with TTL-based health
  - Service metadata and versioning support

#### Infrastructure

- **Event Bus**: NATS JetStream and in-memory backends
  - `bus.JetStreamEventBus` for production messaging
  - `bus.MemoryEventBus` for testing
  - Automatic protobuf serialization/deserialization
  - Topic naming conventions for CQC events
  - Middleware support (retry, logging, metrics)

- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection pooling
  - `database.Pool` with configurable min/max connections
  - Transaction helpers with automatic rollback
  - `WithTransaction` for safe transaction management

  - Health checking

- **Cache**: Redis client with protobuf support
  - `cache.Redis` client with connection pooling
  - Native protobuf message serialization
  - Cache-aside pattern with `GetOrLoad`

#### Observability

- **Logging**: Structured logging with zerolog
  - Zero-allocation JSON logging
  - Trace context propagation
  - HTTP/gRPC middleware for request logging
  - Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics collection
  - Standard HTTP metrics (duration, count, size)
  - Standard gRPC metrics
  - Type-safe metric constructors
  - HTTP/gRPC middleware for automatic collection
  - Custom metric registration

- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
  - W3C trace context propagation
  - OTLP exporter for Jaeger/Tempo
  - Span creation with automatic parent linking
  - HTTP/gRPC middleware for automatic instrumentation
  - Configurable sampling rates

- **Health Checks**: Liveness and readiness endpoints
  - `/health/live` for liveness probes
  - `/health/ready` for readiness probes with dependency checks
  - Database, cache, and event bus health checkers
  - JSON response with per-component status

#### Foundation

- **Configuration**: Environment and file-based config
  - YAML and JSON support via Viper
  - Environment variable override with prefixes
  - Validation for required fields
  - Default value support
  - Type-safe configuration structs

- **Authentication**: API key and JWT middleware
  - `auth.APIKeyMiddleware` for API key validation
  - `auth.JWTMiddleware` for JWT token validation
  - HTTP and gRPC interceptors
  - RSA public key verification
  - Claims validation (exp, iss, aud)
  - Auth context injection

- **Errors**: Typed error system
  - Error classification (Permanent, Temporary, NotFound, InvalidInput, Unauthorized)
  - HTTP status code mapping
  - gRPC status code mapping
  - Error wrapping with context preservation
  - Recovery middleware for panic handling

- **Retry**: Exponential backoff retry logic
  - Configurable retry policies (PolicyTemporary, PolicyAll, PolicyNone)
  - Exponential backoff with jitter
  - Context cancellation support
  - Max attempts configuration
  - Per-error-type retry policies

#### Testing & Examples

### Known Limitations

- Database package coverage lower due to integration-test-heavy design (unit tests cover all testable logic)
- Bus package coverage reflects JetStream-specific code paths not exercised in unit tests
- All packages meet functional requirements and production-ready status

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features (Post-MVP)
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Rate limiting (token bucket/sliding window)
- Secret management integration (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager)
- etcd3 registry backend
- Distributed locks
- Hot reload configuration
